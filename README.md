# ExamForge

Full-stack learning management, assessment, and examination platform built with React, Node.js, Express, Prisma, and MySQL.

## What it does

ExamForge handles the full cycle of online education — course management, question banks, timed exams with anti-cheat, auto-grading, assignments, certifications, and a role-based dashboard for admins, teachers, students, and proctors.

**Stack:**

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Hook Form, Zod |
| Backend | Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, JWT |
| Database | MySQL 8.4 |
| DevOps | Docker Compose, Nginx reverse proxy |

## Getting started

### With Docker (recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# open .env and fill in real secrets (at least JWT_ACCESS_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET, DB passwords)

docker compose up --build
```

Once everything is up:

- **App:** http://localhost:8080
- **API:** http://localhost:8080/api/health
- **MySQL:** localhost:3307

### Without Docker

```bash
# backend
cd backend
npm install
cp ../.env .env          # or create your own
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run seed
npm run dev              # runs on http://localhost:4000

# frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev              # runs on http://localhost:5173
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to `localhost:4000`.

### Login

After seeding, these accounts are available:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@examforge.dev | Admin123! |
| Teacher | teacher@examforge.dev | Teacher123! |
| Student | student@examforge.dev | Student123! |
| Proctor | proctor@examforge.dev | Proctor123! |

Public registration creates `STUDENT` accounts only. Teacher and administrator accounts are created by an authenticated administrator from **Admin > Users**; the admin supplies the email, username, role, and temporary password.

## Role workflows

| Role | Main responsibility | Capabilities |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| Admin | Platform owner | Create staff and student accounts, manage access, and review users, tests, assignments, results, and audit activity |
| Teacher | Course owner | Build courses, quizzes, coding assessments, and assignments; assign work; grade responses; review results and proctoring flags |
| Student | Learner | Register, join courses, take quizzes, submit assignments and code, and review feedback, results, certificates, and progress |

- [ ] Docker-in-Docker code execution sandbox
- [ ] Redis job queue (BullMQ) for email, analytics, cleanup
- [ ] Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack
- [ ] Frontend: charts (Recharts), skeleton loaders, deeper mobile polish
- [ ] Unit tests (Vitest), integration tests, E2E (Playwright)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation site

## Security

- JWT with refresh token rotation and DB revocation
- bcrypt (12 rounds) for passwords
- Rate limiting on auth routes
- RBAC at middleware level
- Zod validation on all external input
- Anti-cheat event tracking during exams
- Helmet.js security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- No trust of client-provided roles, timers, or marks — everything verified server-side

## Contributing

1. Check existing code before modifying
2. Don't remove existing functionality
3. Controllers stay thin — business logic goes in services
4. Validate all external input with Zod
5. Add auth checks at middleware level
6. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` before committing (backend)
7. Run `npm run build` in frontend to verify the build
